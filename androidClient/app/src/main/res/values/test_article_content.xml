        <p><b>CSK registered 8 wicket win against SRH in IPL 2018 final. Shane Watson&#8217;s unbeaten 117 helped pave way for CSK&#8217;s third IPL title.</b></p>\n<p><strong>10:50 PM</strong>: Well, Well! That chase was nothing short of a piece of art with the artist being Shane Watson and his canvas being the Wankhede Stadium. He has truly entertained us all with 11 fours and 8 sixes. CSK have engraved their name on that prestigious IPL trophy for the third time now. Allegations of match-fixing, endless hatred, and attacks from trolls for their aged players, CSK has put an end to all of this with their surreal performance throughout the tournament. And congrats to the Thala himself, MS Dhoni for leading a new, yet experienced team towards victory. SRH also deserve appreciation for their consistency throughout the tournament. They might have been the losing side tonight, but they have introduced us with the future of Indian Bowling, and hell yes, it&#8217;s very bright!</p>\n<p><strong>10:41 PM</strong>: That&#8217;s it then! MS Dhoni affords himself a smile as the dugout charges onto the field. Rayudu plays it square on the off side, taking his moment in the sun and distracting the cameras from Watson for a second. How comfortably CSK have chased this down! SRH and their incredibly consistent captain can hold their heads high, but holding their heads high or not, they must walk off the field. Chennai Super Kings, with a new crew and new stars, have not disappointed their vocal fans who expected no less than a cup win from them.</p>\n<p><strong>10:38 PM</strong>: Watson just trolled the CSK dugout by not hitting the winning runs on the last ball of the 18th over.</p>\n<p><strong>10:35 PM</strong>: Oh dear, Deepak Hooda lets the ball under him in his desperate dive. Merely a sarcastic role-play of how the match has snuck away from SRH. They&#8217;re still out there, trying to drag it back. The veteran Watson, meanwhile, doffs his hat &#8211; what a knock for the occasion! A franchise which was criticised for splurging on older players is now having the last laugh. 10 needed off 15.</p>\n<p><strong>10:25 PM</strong>: Timeout! Rayudu probably not the best batsman to send out as he kills the momentum with a solitary leg bye off Rashid&#8217;s over &#8211; a scarcely believable over in the context of this match situation. Nevertheless, Watson looks set to reach his ton and CSK firm favourites here on. CSK 146-2 from 15 overs.</p>\n<p><strong>10:15 PM: </strong>Looks like Watson means nothing but business and wants to finish things off early! The partnership has now jumped to 117*. Raina&#8217;s old enemy bouncer knocks on his door and he falls prey to Brathwaite&#8217;s deadly one! Can SRH turn the tables from here? Rayudu is the new man in. 134-2 after 13.4</p>\n<p><strong>10:05 PM</strong>: CSK look to be on a roll, with nine wickets left and a rampaging Watson at the crease along with a steady Raina. SRH not out of this yet, with the required run rate still above 9. CSK 104-1 in 12 overs.</p>\n<p><strong>9:55 PM</strong>: Dr Watson finally seems to have decoded the mystery of SRH&#8217;s bowling as he smashes 16 runs of the ninth over. A strong-headed Raina supports him for a 54* run partnership. 73-1 after 9 overs.</p>\n<p><strong>9:45 PM</strong>: A quiet over from mystery spinner Rashid Khan just as Watson and Raina were finding their timing. With big overs against Sandeep and Kaul, Watson has regained the strike-rate from those miserable Bhuvneshwar overs where he looked at sea. CSK 56-1 after 8 at the timeout.</p>\n<p><strong>9:35 PM</strong>: Rashid Khan does an AB De Villiers on the field while saving a boundary from Watson&#8217;s bat. SRH are dominating the game with their exceptional bowling and fielding. And as I say that, Watson hits a big one for Six! And a four now! Well, I think I was too quick in my judgement. And now a run out chance! I am tired of typing! Too much has happened in this over. Raina dives to save himself. NOT OUT! Powerplay ends. 35-1 after 6 overs.</p>\n<p><strong>9:25 PM:</strong> Bhuvaneshwar Kumar with another near-perfect over, not a perfect one, thanks to Hooda&#8217;s four overthrows. CSK are struggling quite hard. And Sandeep ends Faf&#8217;s innings with a C&amp;B. 16-1 after 4 overs.</p>\n<p><strong>9:10 PM: </strong>And the CSK Thalas arrive! Bhuvaneshwar Kumar bowls a maiden first over. Shane Watson must be recalling that spell by Wahab Riaz!</p>\n<p><strong>Innings break! Shakib looked happy to defend 178 in a brief interview, while CSK keep some momentum after a damage-controlling last over. Can CSK enhance an already great comeback season with a third IPL crown? Stay tuned, chase coming up!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>8:50 PM</strong>: Thakur refuses to succumb under the pressure of death overs. 10 runs from the last over with a wicket of Brathwaite who was breathing fire some time ago. The orange army ends the innings at a decent 178 for six wickets after 20 overs. Stay tuned!</p>\n<p><strong>8:40 PM: </strong>Yusuf is finally coming good for SRH as he enters the 40s striking at nearly 200. Brathwaite, who tormented CSK with the bat in the qualifier, joins him. Bravo bowls out having conceded 46 off his four. SRH 160-5 with two overs to go.</p>\n<p><strong>8:30 PM: </strong>When it comes to taking brilliant catches, Raina is a pro. Yet another awesome catch to dismiss Shakib. Bravo gets his first for the day! Yusuf Pathan is looking strong. Hooda comes in to support Yusuf. Can the orange army redeem itself? 136-4 after 16.3.</p>\n<p><strong>8:20 PM</strong>: The Yusuf-Shakib partnership is looking dangerous for CSK, whose duo of spinners is taking some beating. 126-3 after 15.</p>\n<p><strong>8:10 PM</strong>: After hitting some massive strokes, Williamson falls prey to Karn Sharma&#8217;s clever one. Dhoni being Dhoni as always. Lightening Fast Stumping! The big hitter Yusuf Pathan walks in to bat at no. 5. And boy does he begin with the big hitting! 4 runs! A single to end the 13th over. 108-3 after 13.</p>\n<p><strong>8:00 PM</strong>: A miscue nearly brought about Williamson&#8217;s end, but he survives! What&#8217;s more, it goes for four. Shakib clubs two more boundaries to complete an expensive over. 90-2 off 11 overs now.</p>\n<p><strong>7:</strong><strong>50 PM: </strong>Shikhar Dhawan loses his wicket to Ravindra Jadeja. A slow innings it was. Shakib comes in next to bat and starts with a four! Williamson stands strong for his team. 70-2 it is.</p>\n<p><strong>7:40 PM</strong>: Kane Williamson strikes a four and six off the last two balls of a challenging Dwayne Bravo over, which also had 3 dot balls! And that brings us to the timeout. 62-1 it is.</p>\n<p><strong>7:30 PM</strong>: SRH&#8217;s talisman batsmen Dhawan and Williamson slowly find their shots as SRH end the powerplay with 42 runs, for the loss of Shreevats Goswami.</p>\n<p><strong>7:20 PM: </strong>And Goswami gets run out! Vintage Dhoni at his best yet again! Williamson, the orange cap holder comes in to bat next.</p>\n<p><strong>7:10 PM:</strong> CSK skipper puts his faith in D Chahar for the first over of the IPL Final. SRH openers Shreevats Goswami and Shikhar Dhawan on to a steady start with just 6 runs in the first over.</p>\n<p><strong>Preview</strong></p>\n<p>It has been a long journey. 59 matches. 10 venues. 8 teams. 149 players. All of it narrows down to this day. After battling tooth and nail for the prestigious IPL trophy, only two teams remain: Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad. Tonight, a prolonged question will be answered. &#8220;Who will take away the title of winners of the 2018 edition of IPL?&#8221; Will the &#8216;sun rise&#8217; for Hyderabad or will Chennai be the &#8216;super&#8217;ior team?</p>\n<p><strong>Some Facts You Must Know Before The Final</strong></p>\n<p>&#8211; SRH and CSK, the final two teams, also finished first and second respectively in the points table before the playoffs.<br />\n&#8211; This is the seventh IPL final CSK have stepped into out of the 9 seasons they have been a part of, having won the trophy twice.<br />\n&#8211; SRH have appeared in 6 seasons, and today will be their second appearance in an IPL final. They have tasted victory once in 2016.<br />\n&#8211; Ambati Rayudu (586* runs) has been the star performer for CSK this season while Shardul Thakur (15* wickets) has proved to be a handy bowler for the team.<br />\n&#8211; SRH have been the quarry of star performers this season with Kane Williamson having scored 688 runs till now and both Siddhant Kaul and Rashid Khan having taken 21 wickets each.<br />\n&#8211; Led by Captain Cool MS Dhoni, CSK have been a great batting side but have struggled with their bowling.<br />\n&#8211; On the other hand, defending low totals has been Williamson&#8217;s SRH&#8217;s claim to fame this season with an exceptional bowling line-up. Their batting has been a roller-coaster ride throughout the season though.<br />\n&#8211; SRH haven&#8217;t been able to beat CSK in their three tete-a-tete battles even once this season, despite being the best team (on the point table) of the season.<br />\nIf SRH beats CSK today, it doesn&#8217;t even matter how many times CSK defeated them during the course of the tournament. Can SRH do it? Or will CSK will make them numb, yet again?</p>\n<p>Stay tuned as DoJMA covers the IPL finale LIVE! Catch live scores and updates of the much anticipated final from DoJMA.</p>\n
